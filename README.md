dndsh is an interactive shell purpose-built for the Dungeons and Dragons© tabletop RPG by Wizards of the Coast.

When initially launching the program, you will be met with the dndsh shell, which looks similar to the following:

┌─[<NO_NAME>]─(0/0 (0))
└─Đ₦Đ─$

This screen displays the currently loaded character name, along with their heath (current/max (temp)).

Just like any other shell, you interact with it by sending commands and any associated parameters, executing the desired command by pressing the enter key. You may exit the shell at any time by running the "exit" command.
