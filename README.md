# dndsh

`dndsh` is an interactive and extensible shell purpose-built for the Dungeons and DragonsÂ© tabletop RPG by Wizards of the Coast.

## Disclaimer

This project is entirely developed independantly of Wizards of the Coast. I am not associated in anyway with Wizards of the Coast. To any WOTC lawyers eyeing me up, I will not be adding information that would negate the need for players to puchase your products (e.g. spell descriptions).

## How to use

When initially launching the program, you will be met with the `dndsh` shell, which looks similar to the following:

![prompt](https://imgur.com/YY66YSC.png)

The prompt displays the currently loaded character name, along with their heath (**current/max** *(temp)*).

Just like any other shell (sh, bash, cmd, etc.), you interact with it by typing a command along with any associated parameters and then executing the desired command by pressing the Enter key. You may exit the shell at any time by running the "exit" command.

## Installation instructions

Run `./install.sh` as root

## Writing programs for dndsh

<ins>***Please do not create programs until after 1.0.0 is released, as I want to make sure all intended basic functionality is added first***</ins>

When writing programs which may be called within the `dndsh` shell, the program *must* adhere to the following standard:
- The name of the executable must start with "dndsh-"
- The program will be given the following argv parameters when called by `dndsh`:
  - [0] The full path to the the called program (like any other program being called by a shell)
  - [1] The name of the currently selected character
  - [2] - [(n-1)]. All additional arguments given by the user for the program
  - [n] NULL (per `posix_spawn()` requirements).

Newlines are automatically placed before and after the output to reduce on-screen clutter, so this does not need to be added to the individual programs unless desired.
